Welcome!

This Makefile allows you to build yourself a multiboot cd with fixed amount of components:
 - Finnix (http://finnix.org)
 - SystemRescueCD (http://sysresccd.org)
 - GRUB4DOS (http://grub4dos-chenall.googlecode.com)
 - Debian testing netinstall (http://debian.org)
 - Porteus (http://porteus.org/)

Useful make rules:

all: build live cd contents
iso: make iso-image
install-usb: install multi-boot compilation to usb-drive (you'll have to define TARGET=/dev/sdXY)
clean: self-explanatory :)
burn: burn the image on the disk
format-usb: format the usb-drive (mkfs + install-mbr)
