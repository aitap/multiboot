find replacements for the dead distros
 - keep sysrcd by default, it's still alive
 - porteus seems alive too, release 2016-12, keep it optional
 - drop slax (last beta in 2013), finnix (release 2015)
 - add Knoppix (optional because it's HUGE)
 - add Kaspersky, DrWeb (optional because of non-freeness)
drop the "cd" act, it's solely thumbdrives now
 - drop the 700M restriction
 - start things from ISO images most of the time?
  - may have to switch to GRUB2
try harder to preserve file paths, allowing things like "netboot server" to function
EFI support seems imminent
 - another cause for move to GRUB2?
 - less painful (as in: minimal user interaction) Secure Boot solution?
GRUB2 support?
 - will have to trash the syslinux.pm
  - it will remain in our hearts
