find replacements for the dead distros
 - add Kaspersky, DrWeb (optional because of non-freeness)
drop the "cd" act, it's solely thumbdrives now
 - start things from ISO images most of the time?
  - may have to switch to GRUB2
  - maybe download right into the target file
maybe drop most of the stamp files
try harder to preserve file paths, allowing things like "sysrcd netboot server" to function
EFI support seems imminent
 - another cause for move to GRUB2?
 - less painful (as in: minimal user interaction) Secure Boot solution?
GRUB2 support?
 - will have to trash the syslinux.pm
  - it will remain in our hearts
