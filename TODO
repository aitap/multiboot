GRUB2 support?
 - will have to trash the syslinux.pm
  - it will remain in our hearts
 - hack together a syslinux->GRUB2 translator
  - check for EFI and disable linux16 images
  - translate ifcpu64.c32 and other c32 when possible
find replacements for the dead distros
 - add Kaspersky, DrWeb (optional because of non-freeness)
EFI support seems imminent
 - another cause for move to GRUB2?
 - less painful (as in: minimal user interaction) Secure Boot solution?
